In this kata you learn how to use [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com).

**Attention**

This project is incomplete at the moment.

Many thanks to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=kata-rabbitmq) who provide an [Open Source License](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/) for this project ❤️.

# Required Steps

1. Launch an instance of RabbitMQ (e.g. https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq)
2. Create a "robot" application which ...
   1. programmatically creates a message queue to transmit light sensor information (just some arbitrary values of ambient light)
   2. periodically sends light sensor information to the queue
3. Create a robot monitor application which consumes the message from the queue and displays them on the screen

# Development

## Prerequisites

To compile, test and run this project the latest [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) is required on your machine.

## Build, Test, Run

On any computer with the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) run the following commands from the folder containing the `kata-rabbitmq.sln` file in order to build, test and run the application:

To build the project and run the acceptance tests

```sh
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

To run the application in a production environment

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

To run the application and RabbitMQ on your development PC

```sh
docker-compose rabbit up -d
cd kata-rabbitmq.robot.app/bin/Debug/net5.0
DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT=Development dotnet "kata-rabbitmq.robot.app"
docker-compose down
```

If you would like to run and debug the application in your IDE, make sure that
the environment variable `DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT` is set to `Development` so that
the application uses the RabbitMQ settings from `appsettings.Development.json`.

## Identify Code Duplication (Windows only)

The `tools\dupfinder.bat` file calls the [JetBrains dupfinder](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/dupFinder.html) tool and creates an HTML report of duplicated code blocks in the solution directory.

In order to use the `tools\dupfinder.bat` you need to globally install the [JetBrains ReSharper Command Line Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/ReSharper_Command_Line_Tools.html)

From the folder containing the `.sln` file run

```
tools\dupfinder.bat
```

The report will be created as `dupfinder-report.html` in the current directory.
